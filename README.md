# vue-twitter
A quick starter project for learning how Vue Works


# Demo
see the demo at [https://dick-ey/github.io/vue-twitter](https://dick-ey/github.io/vue-twitter)


# Setup
if you want to start from scratch, you'll want to clone the project, and in the proect's root directory open a terminal and run 

`$ git checkout start`.

Then you can just open index.html in your browser. Nothing fancy.
